                        Happy birthday, baba ko!!! 🥳🎈🎉
                        Today is a very special day because it's the day you came into this world—and I'm so grateful I get to celebrate it with you. You're more than just my girlfriend; you're the reason I feel different emotions from day to day and that makes me feel special to feel those emotions from someone dear to me. 
                        <br><br>
                        I admire your kindness, your smiles that make my heart melt, and the you care for the people around you. You inspire me to be a better person just by being yourself.
                        <br><br>
                        When I look back at the moments we've shared together, from the first meet, first little laughs to the deeper conversations. For the past years I've pray to God to give me someone I can say my own, and then suddenly, you came exactly at the time where I needed someone to talk to (even though I didn't reply to you so fast or regularly hehe),  I can't help but feel blessed and I'm excited for all the new ones we’ll make together.
                        <br><br>
                        As you step into 17, I wish you nothing but happiness, growth, and endless love. May this year be full of opportunities, adventures, and everything your heart desires. 
                        <br><br>
                        An as for me, I promise I'll be here for you—cheering you on, holding your hand, and loving you more with every day that passes.
                        <br><br>
                        Happy birthday, babycake 🎉😘. Enjoy your special day, my baby! 😘
                        <br><br>
